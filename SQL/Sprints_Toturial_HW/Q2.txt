Problem:
1- Find the names of the top 10 employees who sold the most number of orders, and order
them in descending order showing the highest first.

Note:
- The rest should be Employee_FirstName, Employee_LastName, Number_of_Orders
- You can google any syntax you want


Solution:
SELECT employees.FirstName AS Employee_FirstName, employees.lastname AS
Employee_LastName, count(orders.orderID) AS Number_of_orders
FROM [Orders]
INNER JOIN [employees] on [Orders].employeeID = [employees].employeeID
GROUP BY employees.employeeid
ORDER BY count(orders.orderid) desc
LIMIT 10
