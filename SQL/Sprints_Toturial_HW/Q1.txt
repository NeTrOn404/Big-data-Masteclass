Problem:
Find the names of the top 10 customers who spent the most money,
and order them showing the highest first, the result should look like
the below:

Note:
- Round the total_sales to 2 decimal points
- You can google any syntax you want



Solution:
SELECT CustomerName, round(SUM(Total_Price),2) as Total_Sales from (
SELECT [Customers].CustomerName, [ORDERS].OrderID, [OrderDetails].ProductID,
[OrderDetails].Quantity, [Products].Price as Price_ea, [OrderDetails].Quantity *
[Products].Price AS Total_Price
FROM [Customers]
INNER JOIN [ORDERS] ON [Customers].CustomerID = [ORDERS].CustomerID
INNER JOIN [OrderDetails] ON [ORDERS].OrderID = [OrderDetails].OrderID
INNER JOIN [Products] ON [OrderDetails].ProductID = [Products].ProductID
)
group by CustomerName
order by SUM(Total_Price) desc
limit 10
